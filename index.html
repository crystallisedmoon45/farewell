    <h1>Dear Mr Clark, thanks for all the support you have done for us over the past 2 years. The support over the 2 years you have given us all is unreal. The woodlands children cannot express how greatful we are to have a fun, courageous and 
chilled out teacher like you. We cannot believe that you are leaving us after supporting us for 1 full year and all the work you did for us in SENCO. (I think thats how you spell it?) anyway, the staff and children wish you a good time at
your next job. We think you will be an amazing headteacher if you get to the role. Consider this as a good luck and goodbye message from us. Kind regards,
-The Woodlands centre (Arthur did make this thoughðŸ¤£)</h1>
